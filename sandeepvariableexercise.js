// sandeep variable assignment -- Allyson Escobar, March 19 2018

// A refugee inputs the number of members in their family.
// Based on that number, you tell them how much money they will receive as assistance based on the following: 
//  Each family member is given a one-time grant of $1,000 in 2018. Refugee families arriving in 2019 might get more or less depending on the State Department funding priorities. 
// You need to know if the head of household speaks English. The refugee (and their family members) will be settled in the New York City where there are 5 NGOs that might help them. 
// The five NGOs are "Help Unlimited", "New Start", "Better Tomorrow", "Home Safe" and "New Home". 
// Monthly estimated expenses: $800 for one person, $950 for a couple, $1000 for a family of three, $1100 family of four, $1200 for family of 5+.
